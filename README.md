# Resume Site
A fun and different spin on an old, dry paper resume and cover letter! A react web app that gives you a little insight to myself, and some of my skills.

## Dependencies
All you will need is npm installed locally.

## Running locally
Simply run `npm start` and the app will launch and direct your webpage to `localhost:3000`.

## Coming soon
Better yet than having to run it locally, you can view this page on a gitpages page, right here {link coming}
